## 📖 Abstract
Using the ARDL-ECM framework, this study assesses the asymmetric effects of monetary policy shocks on three credit-dependent sectors in India — **Banking, Real Estate, and Auto** — covering **2007 to 2025**.  
Structural breaks were identified using the **Bai-Perron test**, and three control variables were included:  
- Global spillovers (S&P 500)  
- Exchange rate (USD/INR)  
- Inflation (WPI)  

Findings:  
- Equity markets are not highly vulnerable to domestic monetary policy shocks.  
- Sectoral and regime-specific differences exist.  
- Global factors and structural breaks strongly shape the outcomes.
